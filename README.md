# TelegramNotification_fromCtrader

hello this bot sends a message to a telegram channel on every bar opening, noticing if we had a bull or a bear cross of the indicator (SSL in this case) if no signal, an idle message
Remember that to make it work you need to create a bot, create a channel, add the bot to the channel and add to your code the appropriate token id and chat id.
have fun.
